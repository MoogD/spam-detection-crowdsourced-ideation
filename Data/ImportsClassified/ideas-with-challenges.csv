For example, if you think that your professor is not very nice, you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis. Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable, even though it really wasn’t. In other words, you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did. Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking, in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something; for example, you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation, because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors","unusable","FABRIC_DISPLAY"

We have to begin with a simple optical or radar emailing device such as a sense or like the newer cars have to prevent accidents.

This would require a pretty advanced AI subroutine that wouldn't necessarily be beyond today's current technology. Recognizing movements would be relatively easy, recognizing specific objects, however, would be a little trickier. You couldn't possibly program every shape size and configuration of everything that moves. So then, the programming would have to be able to discern those shapes.
